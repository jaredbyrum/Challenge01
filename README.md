## Code Refactor Challenge
# Description
This project is Challenge 01. In this challenge, as bootcamp student we had to refactor the starter code to meet industry accessibilty standards by using semantic HTML elements. As well as simplifying the CSS selectors and removing any possible bloat. 

It's finished when it is refactored following the scout rule, and looks like the markup provided. As well as when it is deployed live to GitHub pages.
